                    Create a web application with ASP.NET in C# that uses a persistent cookie to track 
                    how many times a client computer has visited the page. In addition to the number 
                    of hits, the application also needs to display the IP address of the client 
                    computer and the time zone where the client computer is located.

                    My interpretation of this first part is that a web application is to be created 
                    using the ASP.NET in C# framework. The page should count the number of times that 
                    a user visits a page through the use of persistant cookies. As well, there should 
                    be the IP address of the client computer displayed along with the time zone of 
                    the computer. Thus, there should only be three elements on the page, which are 
                    the number of times the website has been visited by a client computer, the 
                    ip address of the computer, and the timezone of where the computer located. There 
                    can be an additional button that is dedicated to refreshing the page.

                    In the specifications, it does not define the the time that the cookie should persist for, 
                    so an arbitrary but reasonable time can be assumed. Additionally, the IP address of the 
                    client computer and their time zone also need to be displayed. Since these are 
                    client-side properties, the information should be retrieved through some client-side 
                    code, such as JavaScript. This code should exist in the aspx file as part of the 
                    ASP.NET application.

                <p class="title4">
                    In the code, the persistant cookies are defined as HttpCookies. The name of the cookie that stores 
                    the number of visits is called visitCount and it is created by using the HttpCookie object and 
                    passing in visitCount as the string for the name of the cookie. This cookie is only created if a 
                    cookie does not already exist. The creation of the cookie initializes the value to 0 and gives 
                    the cookie an expiry time of 24 hours, or one day. If a cookie already exists, then retrieve the 
                    value of the cookie and increment the value, then store it back into the cookie. Afterwards, the 
                    textbox for the number of cookies is updated to the value stored in the cookie. Next, a function 
                    that gets the user's IP address is called. The timezone of the user is retrieved through using 
                    a JavaScript method called getTimezoneOffset to get the time difference between UTC time and 
                    local time. This value is divided by 60 to get the number of hours different. As well, the 
                    UTC value is also also returned by using the toUTCString function in JavaScript. This converts 
                    the Date object into UTC time set by World Time Standard.

                    A web application, developed using ASP.NET in C#, for running a slideshow of pictures is to be developed. The 
                    information about the pictures should be stored on the server in a database or text file, and the information 
                    can include the name of the image and its location (or combined into a path to the image) and the caption for 
                    ths image. I interpret this as, the path to the image and the image caption are stored together in a text file, 
                    for every image that will be used, where the images are stored in a specified directory on the server and the 
                    text file, which is also stored on the server, can be read to retrieve the location of the file on the server 
                    and the caption of the image. As well, there should be a caption displayed under each image, where the caption 
                    is the same caption that is stored in the text file. The should be a toggle button that switches between start 
                    and stop, to start and stop the slideshow, a button that toggles between random and sequential, to display the 
                    images in a random or sequential order. As well, there should be two buttons, one for forward and one for 
                    backward, which can only be used in sequential mode, disabled in random mode. This allows the images to be 
                    displayed in order in the forward or backward direction. As well, the same images from assignment 1 part 3 can 
                    be used because the assignment is similar to this one and also requires at least 20 pictures.

                <span class="title2">Analysis and Design of the Web Application</span>
                <p class="title4">
                    Since the web application is to be created using ASP.NET and C#, all of the user interface and server based 
                    logic resides in the web design page and the backend cs file for the page. The text file and images should 
                    reside in a folder dedicated to containing extraneous files such as images and text files. The file location 
                    should be the relative file path to the images and it should always point to the image files in this folder. 
                    The text file is be designed to be line separated for each image and comma separated for the location and 
                    image caption. The form should be designed to include the title of the application, as well as buttons for 
                    the start/stop, random/sequential, forward, and backward. These buttons will be lined up horizontally to 
                    make an area where the user can easily find and use the buttons. As well, an additional feature to allow the 
                    user to control the time between image transitions would increase the useability and functionality of the 
                    application. This is implemented as a textbox that accepts the number of seconds between image transitions 
                    and a button to apply the change. Underneath these buttons, the image will be displayed and below the image, 
                    a label containing the image caption will be displayed. For the forward and backward buttons, they should 
                    only be available to press if the mode is sequential. Otherwise, the mode will be random and these buttons
                    should be grayed out and unuseable.

                    the ScriptManager, which is used in conjunction with the timer in the application (the timer will be discussed

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There should be a list of computers, lists of different parts or components (no less than five different components including at least RAM, 
                        hard drive, CPU, display, OS, and soundcard) of computers that can be reviewed by customers. At this stage, the information about these products 
                        can be hard-coded into the HTML or program files.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A customer can select a computer with default/standard configuration and pricing, and then customize it by changing its configuration, that 
                        is, by replacing one component with another from a list of compatible components.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whenever a change has been made by the customer, the price total needs to be dynamically changed and displayed to the customer, in an area 
                        embedded in the online store, not in a pop-up window.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After the customer has hit the Buy or Add to Cart or something similar, a summary of selections, including all the details of the customized 
                        computer and its pricing, should be displayed in the browser window.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At this stage, you don’t need to save orders placed by customers in the database. You can use Cookies to store and track customer selections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All links, menus, and buttons within the online store should be active.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    In part 4 of the assignment, you will continue your work completed in part 3, to develop a fully functioning 
                    online computer store (without payment transaction, though). Your tasks for this part are:
                </p>
                <ol class="title4">
                    <li>
                        Add a customer management module to the online computer store, which should include new customer 
                        registration, customer authentication, and password recovery.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add an order management module which will save orders for registered customers and allow registered 
                        customers to manage their orders, including view the list and details of each item in the list and 
                        delete or make changes to a selected order in the list.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Design and implement a back-end database to support your online computer store that does the following.
                        <ol class="title4">
                            <li>
                                Store all the details of the computers and components and replace all the data hard-coded into the 
                                program files with data from the database.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Use the database for all your customer management.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Use the database for all your order management. When an order is submitted, the details of the order, 
                                including pricing, need to be saved in the database, and then displayed in an appropriate format 
                                to the customer.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="title4">

                <p class="title4">
                    In your assignment report on the main page (tma3a.htm), show the design of the database tables, and 
                    explain the functionality of each program and web page you developed. You may want to research some 
                    examples in Microsoft’s ASP.NET AJAX Showcase. If you use any code from these examples that is not 
                    part of the standard ASP.NET or ASP.NET Ajax distribution package, <b>you must clearly indicate the 
                    source of the code.</b> However, all the significant components of your system must be developed by yourself.
                </p>
                <p class="title4">
                    Test all parts of the assignment on your own server before you submit Assignment 3A to your tutor. 
                    Make your web server accessible for your tutor to assess your work. For your personal protection you 
                    should not put your name and student ID on an unprotected web site, and after your tutor has assessed 
                    your work, you must remove all the assignment documents from the site.
