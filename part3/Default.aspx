        Welcome to Digital Electronics!
    </h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Here at Digital Electronics, you can begin by starting with a pre-built computer and switch out any components
        you want from our list of available items for maximum customization!
    </p>
    <p>
        As you customize your computer by switching out parts, your total configuration cost will update in real-time to
        accomodate the changes you make! All components in your configuration are highlighted in green.
    </p>
    <p>
        After you are done customizing your computer, you can add it to your cart and see your configuration as a whole!
        After that, you can checkout, delete your system, or add another system by going back to the pre-built computers tab.
    </p>

        If you want to know more about the developer, or would like to ask some questions, visit the Contacts page. Otherwise, 
        you can leave some comments/suggestions on how your experience was on the Feeback page.
    </p>

        Enjoy and Happy Shopping!
